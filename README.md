# email-mey-my-ip

Simple all that polls http://checkip.dyndns.org/ and emails you the IP.  Just update the propeties file with your email and password.

Deploy it on a tomcat and hit http://localhost:8080/getMyIp/stats to see simple stats. 

you will also need to creat two db tables with a few fields or you can simply remove the DB connectivity
